Project description: To make changes in Scanner and Parser and compute McCabe's complexity number for all the functions present in Python program and also to add test-cases in cases directory.

The easiest part of this project: 1. I have used bottom-up approach to find the McCabe's number. Calculating the McCabe's number was easy but was slightly tricky.
				  2. Calculating the McCabe's number for the LOOP(while or for) and IF block were easy.  
					
Problems that I had in completing this project: 1. Clearing the memory was the problem, I tried my best to clear all the meomory leaks. I think there are some still reachable blocks that can be cleared.
						2. Getting McCabe's number for CLASS and TRY-EXCEPT-FINALLY Blocks were tricky, especially getting names of nested Classes and computing McCabe's number for Try-Except when finally is present.
