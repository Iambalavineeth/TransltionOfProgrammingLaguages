Project description: Design and implement an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent and interpret Python code, handling assignments, variables, integers, float values.

The easiest part of this project: 1. This project was similar to previous one, used bottom-up approach to go from bottom of the parse tree to evaluate assignments, integers and floats.
																	2. Building an AST tree for variables, assignment statements, integers and floats
																	3. Object Oriented principles along with the Singleton framework made the work easy

Problems that I had in completing this project: 1. Identifying the correct nodes and adding the semantic actions accordingly for them was tricky.
																								2. Modifying the parse.y was confusing as it was a very large file with lot of nodes  
																								2. Clearing the memory was the problem, I tried my best to clear all the meomory leaks.
