Project description: To make changes in Scanner and Parser and compute McCabe's complexity number for all the functions present in Python program and also to add test-cases in cases directory.

The easiest part of this project: Computing the McCabe number for functions which did not involve try-except block.

Problems that I had in completing this project: 1. Finally has caused multiple issues while writing the code, had to introduce a flag to check whether finally appeared or not in the function.
                                                2. Initially had problems with getting the name of the function, resolved it after seeing the typedStack example.
                                                3. There were no definite memory leaks, but there were 5 blocks of memory which was still reachable.
