Project description: To write a Flex program that accepts a text input and output the text upside down and backwards.

The easiest part of this project: Using of Stack and Map made the problem simple.

Problems that I had in completing this project: Tried to create the map by reading the code.txt line-by-line but was not successful as, I had some problem with the unicode conversion. Eventually, I hardcoded the map with the respective upside-down strings.
